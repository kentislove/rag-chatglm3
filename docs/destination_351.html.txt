Yoho National Park
Yoho National Park was built in 1885, it well protects some scenic spots west of the famous Rocky Mountains in North America. It is full of steep rock barriers, torrential waterfalls and towering cliffs. Yoho National Park is an integral part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, and it is also the world's best-preserved ecological reserve. The word "Yoho" in Cree means awe or surprise. This is an excellent description of the 28 peaks in the park that are over 3,000 meters above sea level. The quiet and wide Emerald Lake is a beautiful attraction like a fairyland, where you can witness the magical changes in the color of the largest glacial lake in the national park. In addition, there is also the world-famous Burgess Shale here. Its discovery has an important role and significance for exploring the Cambrian explosion of life and the early Cambrian biological evolution.
